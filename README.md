# Welcome to r2Playground!

### What is this?

r2Playground is what we've always wanted - an all encompassing resource for learning and playing with radare! It contains comprehensive walkthroughs, presentations, and other radare & reverse engineering paraphernalia. I plan to maintain this for the foreseeable future and highly encourage contributions.

### What's inside?

- Module_Template

### Structure

- Each walkthrough, presentation, etc. is referred to as a _module_.
- Each _module_ will have it's own subdirectory.

#### Each module **must** contain:

1. _module_/README.md file with an overview.
2. _module_/bin directory with any necessary binaries **or** a /bin/README.md with the necessary links
3. _module_/local directory for users to have a workplace that won't be pushed back into the repository if they contribute.

(use Module_Template as a starting point - e.g., cp -r Module_Template New_Module)
